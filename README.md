# Serial Converter – PCB Design (KiCad 9)

This repository contains the design files for a **Serial Converter PCB** created using **KiCad 9**. The board provides a simple and effective solution for converting serial communication levels—ideal for embedded systems, microcontroller interfacing, or general-purpose serial communication debugging.

## 🧰 Features

- ✅ Designed in **KiCad 9**
- 🔄 Converts **TTL ↔ RS232** (or USB, based on configuration)
- 🧱 Compact and modular PCB layout
- 📥 Includes schematics, PCB layout, and ready-to-manufacture Gerber files
- 🌐 Open-source hardware for learning and development

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `*.kicad_pcb` – PCB layout file
- `*.sch` – Schematic diagram (See: [Serial_Converter_Schematic.pdf](./Serial_Converter_Schematic.pdf))
- `*.bom` – Bill of Materials
- `*.gerber/` – Production-ready Gerber files
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation

## 🛠️ Tools Required

- **KiCad 9** (or compatible newer versions)
- A PCB fabrication service (e.g., JLCPCB, OSH Park)
- Basic soldering tools and components (listed in BOM)

## 🧪 Usage

Use this board as a bridge for serial communication between TTL logic devices (like Arduinos, ESP32, STM32, etc.) and RS232 or USB-based interfaces. Modify the schematic to fit your voltage or connector requirements.
